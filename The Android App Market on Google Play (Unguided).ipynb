Introduction\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1197/img/google_play_store.png\" alt=\"Google Play logo\"></p>\n<p>Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be very lucrative from the business standpoint. Specifically, Android is expanding as an operating system and has captured more than 74% of the total market<sup><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009\">[1]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>The Google Play Store apps data has enormous potential to facilitate data-driven decisions and insights for businesses. In this notebook, we will analyze the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories. We will also use the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.</p>\n<p>The dataset you will use here was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps\">Kaggle</a>. Here are the details: <br>\n<br></p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/apps.csv</b></div>\nThis file contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. There are 9 features that describe a given app.\n<ul>\n    <li><b>App:</b> Name of the app</li>\n    <li><b>Category:</b> Category of the app. Some examples are: ART_AND_DESIGN, FINANCE, COMICS, BEAUTY etc.</li>\n    <li><b>Rating:</b> The current average rating (out of 5) of the app on Google Play</li>\n    <li><b>Reviews:</b> Number of user reviews given on the app</li>\n    <li><b>Size:</b> Size of the app in MB (megabytes)</li>\n    <li><b>Installs:</b> Number of times the app was downloaded from Google Play</li>\n    <li><b>Type:</b> Whether the app is paid or free</li>\n    <li><b>Price:</b> Price of the app in US$</li>\n    <li><b>Last Updated:</b> Date on which the app was last updated on Google Play </li>\n\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/user_reviews.csv</b></div>\nThis file contains a random sample of 100 <i>[most helpful first](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/21/google-play-stores-redesigned-ratings-and-reviews-section-lets-you-easily-filter-by-star-rating/)</i> user reviews for each app. The text in each review has been pre-processed and passed through a sentiment analyzer.\n<ul>\n    <li><b>App:</b> Name of the app on which the user review was provided.
